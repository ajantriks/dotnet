Published by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.epw.in/journal/2016/17/web-exclusives/buying-aakash-dream.html&#34;&gt;Economic and Political Weekly&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This research note is based on a project conducted as part of the Max Weber Foundation’s Transnational Research Group on &amp;ldquo;Poverty and Education in India,&amp;rdquo; and draws from a &lt;a href=&#34;../aakash-tablet-and-technological-imaginaries-of-mass-education/&#34;&gt;paper recently published&lt;/a&gt; by the authors in &lt;em&gt;History and Technology&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction:dcf794d4d237a70396527a795b3ef51c&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Aakash tablet, hailed as the vanguard of India&amp;rsquo;s “tablet revolution,” was unveiled at the United Nations. It was to showcase India&amp;rsquo;s technological prowess but was quickly lamented as a failed “dream,” and as India&amp;rsquo;s “object lesson” in how not to do technological innovation. The so-called failure of the device became a metonym for the government that backed it, and for the technology establishment of the country. While our longer paper (Phalkey and Sumandro 2016) questions this notion of “failure,” in this article we wish to highlight the role played by the discourse and experiments in technologies of mass education in creating the practical context and the market conditions for low-cost tablets in India.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A 2011 report by the Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD) claimed that although the initiation of the Aakash tablet project met with “skepticism and scorn,” over time it not only developed an affordable device aimed at students in India, but has produced an entirely new market niche of sub-US$100 tablets. This ambitious statement appears to be vindicated by a recent report by the International Data Corporation (IDC), an economic intelligence company, on the tablet market in India. The report notes that the market has grown in the previous year at an annual rate of 8.2%. More importantly, the two companies leading in market share are DataWind (20.7%) and Samsung (15.8%). Incidentally, after the first quarter of 2014, Samsung had the largest (22.5%) and DataWind the 4th largest (6.8%) share. What is noteworthy here is not the rise of DataWind as the leading seller of tablets alone, but that it is the MHRD that heralded this creation of a market niche in India for affordable tablets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;from-satellite-to-internet-in-education:dcf794d4d237a70396527a795b3ef51c&#34;&gt;From Satellite to Internet in Education&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 30 May, 1974, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) launched an ATS-6 satellite that formed the central infrastructural component of the Satellite Instructional Television Experiment (SITE), one of the early initiatives to harness communication technology for primary and adult education. The SITE project involved broadcasting educational and informational audiovisual content, produced by the All India Radio (AIR), across 2400 selected villages located in Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha (erstwhile Orissa), and Rajasthan. Operating from 1 August 1975 to 31 July 31 1976, the experiment was led by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), and was supported by UNESCO, United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), United Negro College Fund (UNCF), and the International Telecommunication Union (ITU).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The objective of the SITE project was inspired directly by the importance given to skill-development oriented higher education and adult education in the report of the first Education Commission (1964–1966). However, Asif Siddiqi (2015) notes that the project performed a crucial task of establishing the Indian space research programme through a direct alliance with NASA, which held special geopolitical significance given the Chinese nuclear tests of 1964.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This experiment paved the way for the development of the Indian National Satellite System (INSAT,) the first Indian satellite. The entanglement of the Indian space programme with the idea of national-level technological infrastructure for education has continued since. The EDUSAT, launched in 2004, was a collaborative project between ISRO and MHRD to drive satellite-based education across disadvantaged and remote regions of the country. In an audit report in 2013, however, the Department of Space declared that the project has failed, and highlighted three lacks in particular– network connectivity, content generation, and management structure (Union Government 2013).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The earliest initiatives in India to put computers in schools, supplementing and supplanting television screens, began in the 1980s. These efforts pre-dated extensive terrestrial communication fibre networks and relied almost completely upon the success of the Indian space programme. The University Grants Commission (UGC) Countrywide Classroom, Computer Literacy and Studies in Schools, and Computer Literacy and Awareness Programme are the key examples from this time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The revised Programme of Action of the National Policy on Education (1986) reiterated the need for increased attention to upgrading education technology infrastructure, as well as the development of electronic content for the same. This led to the initiation of the ICT@Schools scheme beginning with the 8th Five Year Plan (1993–1998). Even after 20 years of the introduction of computers in schools across India, a 2006 report on education technology by the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) noted that computer-based teaching and learning in an actual classroom setting remains more of a “spectator sport.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the advent of the internet, the MHRD started experimenting with internet-based delivery of distance education from 2003, beginning with the National Programme on Technology Enhanced Learning (NPTEL). It did so alongside satellite-based distribution of educational content. NPTEL involved five Indian Institutes of Technology (IIT) (Bombay, Delhi, Kanpur, Kharagpur, and Madras) developing openly available course materials for more than 100 undergraduate courses in five engineering subjects, as well as courses in basic science. These course materials were later made part of the online learning portal called “Sakshat,” which eventually became one of the pillars of the National Mission on Education through Information and Communication Technologies (NMEICT), initiated during the 11th Five Year Plan (2007–2012). This portal marked the completion of a conceptual and technological shift from the satellite-based models of delivery of educational content, to an internet-based one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;making-and-unmaking-of-the-aakash-tablet:dcf794d4d237a70396527a795b3ef51c&#34;&gt;Making and Unmaking of the Aakash Tablet&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With NMEICT, large-scale education technology initiatives of the Indian state moved away from the earlier emphasis on primary education and school-oriented computer literacy, to that on higher education and aids for self-learning. The plan for an affordable tablet computer was announced in mid-2010 as part of this mission. This “low-cost access-cum-computing device” was aimed at bypassing the institutional, bureaucratic, and infrastructural barriers to access to quality higher education. Its main audience were students in disadvantaged regions and non-elite institutions, as well as self-learners. The actualisation of the device, however, was continuously delayed and blocked by conflicts between the governmental and non-governmental actors, strong skepticism from the media, and several changes in the state&amp;rsquo;s approach to the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first approach to the project was an international company that approached the MHRD in 2006, with a proposal to sell educational laptops for school students at 100 US$ each. NK Sinha, then mission director of NMEICT, argued against the purchase. The MHRD saw this as an opportunity for developing an indigenous low-cost computer, and initiated a competition among the IITs to come up with a prototype for this device, which was won by the IIT Kanpur team led by Prem Kumar Kalra, then professor and head of the department of Electrical Engineering. The first publicly exhibited (2010) prototype of the device was the one developed in IIT Kanpur, which was priced initially at 35 US$.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MHRD, however, soon decided to buy the device from a commercial manufacturer. The responsibility of procurement and testing went to IIT Rajasthan, under the leadership of Kalra who joined the newly established institution as its first director. After the contract with HCL Infosystems was called off in January 2011, DataWind, a Canada and UK based company specialising in internet-access devices, won the new tender to produce the first version of the device. On 5 October 2011, the first version of tablet was launched, priced at Rs 2,500, and co-branded as Aakash and Ubislate—respectively for those bought and redistributed at a subsidised rate by MHRD, and those sold commercially by DataWind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An early controversy about the tablet, apart from its technical capabilities, was around the claim that they were produced and assembled in China. DataWind rejected the allegations and claimed that all the devices were assembled by Quad Electronics in its factory in Secunderabad, Telangana (then Andhra Pradesh). Within a year, however, DataWind got involved in serious conflict with IIT Rajasthan on one hand, and Quad Electronics on the other. The MHRD intervened again to change the approach by bringing in IIT Bombay (March 2012) as the new procuring and testing agency, thus removing IIT Rajasthan from the project. DataWind also found a new partner in VMC Systems, who started assembling the “kits” imported from China in its establishments in Amritsar and Delhi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With M M Pallam Raju becoming the Minister of Human Resource Development in late 2012 by succeeding Kapil Sibal, one might say, the Aakash project gradually moved to what we know as its final form. At first, it was suggested that the state should entirely move out of the business of providing low-cost tablets as there is already a vibrant market. Later on, and with thought leadership from Rajat Moona, director general of the Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (CDAC), and others, it was decided that “Aakash” would become a brand name available for commercial manufacturers of affordable tablets that satisfy a minimum set of technical specifications. The first draft of the specifications list was published in June 2013. The tendering process, however, got delayed, and eventually came to a near-permanent pause with the general elections in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of November 2015, the MHRD has again shown interest in the idea of a state-subsidised tablet computer for education. The tablet was now called Udaan, and aimed at girl students at the higher secondary level, priced at Rs 10,000 (against Rs 2,500 of Aakash), and distributed only to 1,000 students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;creating-device-desire:dcf794d4d237a70396527a795b3ef51c&#34;&gt;Creating Device Desire&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an interview in late 2013, Kapil Sibal (then Union Minister of Communication and Information Technology, former Union Minister of Human Resource Development) shared that “[the] Aakash tablet was [his] dream but it was not fulfilled.” Sibal, undoubtedly the key political driver of the project, in his admission to failure, raises deep concerns about the present state and the future of the technological infrastructure—and the imagination—for mass education in the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tracing the transition of these technologies from SITE to Aakash, we continuously find it difficult to delineate the state’s transforming and transformative agenda of mass education from that of building technological capability. At times, though, we wondered if the agenda for mass education did not become one that served the purpose of generating, for lack of a better phrase, a certain familiarity and literacy about personal technological devices among the population. The motivations and goals that informed these mammoth projects become more and more difficult to decipher when we look at the relatively poor attention given to the production of content. Careful monitoring and documentation of how such content is being received and utilised by the actual learners and their educators was not prioritised; and whenever undertaken, such exercises revealed the deep lack of pedagogic concerns at the heart of these education technology programmes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alongside the overwhelming narrative of failure, however, we cannot ignore the remarkable, but quiet, success of the project in normalising and framing the tablet computer as familiar, and almost essential, object for personal learning and development. Apart from presenting the tablet computer as an everyday media object, almost similar to the way television entered the households, the NMEICT and the Aakash project played a crucial role in normalising the notion of online self-learning, and thus that of the online, in the Indian public imagination. In an insightful comment, Suneet Singh Tuli, the CEO of DataWind, remarked that the Aakash tablet was not an “iPad for the poor,” it was the “the computer and Internet of the masses”—it was not selling a demo version of the real thing, it was shaping the very imagination (Kurup 2011).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These stories, together, conspire to make us wonder if all this eventually amounts to create desires for devices; and if the educational and developmental rhetoric helped frame electronic devices as everyday and household objects. The consequences, as we see, cannot exactly be called unintended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;published-by-design-altruism-project-http-design-altruism-project-org-2013-02-23-can-non-europeans-innovate:6e36930df60a683ee728bc7e1f91008e&#34;&gt;Published by &lt;a href=&#34;http://design-altruism-project.org/2013/02/23/can-non-europeans-innovate/&#34;&gt;Design Altruism Project&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2013/01/2013114142638797542.html&#34;&gt;recent essay&lt;/a&gt;, Hamid Dabashi has spoken out against the continuation of the obnoxious (colonial) practice of identifying European socio-cultural artifacts as the universal form, while the non-European others get prefixed with ‘ethno’ — such as, referring to European music as ‘music’ and studying non-European music as ‘ethnomusicology.’ The same practice appears in action, and often enjoys uncritical celebration, in the domain of design. We are being told that the Indians have a magic word, &lt;em&gt;jugaad&lt;/em&gt;, that means “startling ingenuity in the face of adversity.” The question, however, is why do the Indians need a special word for a phenomena that Europeans (not in the sense of the continent but in vague civilizational terms) simply call &lt;em&gt;innovation&lt;/em&gt;? Or, &lt;em&gt;can non-Europeans innovate&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;../img/jugaad-lunchbox.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;code&#34; title=&#34;Jua kali lunch box, Kenya&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&#34;jua-kali-lunch-box-kenya:6e36930df60a683ee728bc7e1f91008e&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jua kali&lt;/em&gt; lunch box, Kenya.&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before proceeding, I must add that I do not fully agree with Hamid Dabashi in his celebration of a rise of multiple local ‘cosmopolitan worldlinesses.’ I do not believe in a contemporary separation of European and non-European thinking, but in global exchanges through circulating analytical categories and socio-economic markers. Such ‘exchanges’ of course take place in a context of not-so-long-ago colonial history and a continued capitalist present. Further, in understanding the continued capitalist present (and accumulated exploitations of various capitalist and non-capitalist pasts), perhaps one needs to look within and beyond nation-state boundaries, thus making difficult the idea of finding one method or strategy of Indian designs, and other things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adelheid Fischer, among others, &lt;a href=&#34;http://places.designobserver.com/feature/frugal-innovation/37595/&#34;&gt;translates &lt;em&gt;jugaad&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as ‘doing more with less.’ It makes one wonder whether &lt;em&gt;innovation&lt;/em&gt; does not involve the same principle? The market-friendly definition of &lt;em&gt;innovation&lt;/em&gt; explains that it combines invention with value-creation. Now how can something create (exchange) value unless it does ‘more with less’? It is indeed reassuring to know that &lt;em&gt;jugaad&lt;/em&gt; is not a specialty of a particular branch of non-Europeans, but similar tendencies can be found elsewhere in the non-European world too, such as the Kenyan &lt;em&gt;jua kali&lt;/em&gt; and the Mexican &lt;em&gt;rasquachismo&lt;/em&gt;. Further, such a non-European mode of what-Europeans-call-&lt;em&gt;innovation&lt;/em&gt;-when-they-do-it involves more than just ‘doing more with less.’ It involves an attitude, one that comes along when one has the “capacity to hold life together with bits of string, old coffee cans, and broken mirrors in a dazzling gesture of aesthetic bravado.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now at last one sees the reason for differentiating between &lt;em&gt;innovation&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;jugaad&lt;/em&gt;. Unlike the former, the latter is characterized by an auto-aestheticization of the culture of scarcity, by a will to live life within the constraints of colonial/neocolonial/capitalist subjugation and not attempt to question and overcome such oppressions. As Western military think-tanks declare ‘slums of the urban south’ as final battlefields in the War Against Terror, one might appreciate and congratulate this form of ‘worldview of the have-not’ that encourages residents of the ‘global south’ to live with dignity within material constraints. What’s more is that most &lt;em&gt;jugaad&lt;/em&gt; vehicles do not actually meet “crash-test standards in the U.S.” I suppose the death of slum residents due to faulty &lt;em&gt;jugaad&lt;/em&gt; vehicles does help Navy Seals in the long run, by reducing the number of potential terrorists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;../img/jugaad-jeep.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;code&#34; title=&#34;Jeep by Schulz &amp;amp; Schräder, Mixed media, 2003&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&#34;jeep-by-schulz-schräder-mixed-media-2003-photography-by-helmut-kunde:6e36930df60a683ee728bc7e1f91008e&#34;&gt;Jeep by Schulz &amp;amp; Schräder, Mixed media, 2003. Photography by Helmut Kunde.&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To complete the offensive narrative of &lt;em&gt;jugaad&lt;/em&gt;, Adelheid Fischer goes on to find its equivalent practices within Europe’s past. This follows much-critiqued (but clearly not sufficiently so) colonial anthropological and orientalist narratives — what Indians do today reflects what Europeans used to do in the middle ages — of civilizational backwardness of the ‘global south’. Adelheid Fischer concludes with a grateful nod to the driver who guided her “through the terrifying wilderness of India’s back roads.” I am sure that in good old colonial days, no ‘mahout’ would have received a similar thankful note in the diary of the colonial ‘sahib’ after a successful tiger hunt. Clearly, we all have progressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enough sarcasm. In the later part of her Design Observer post, Fischer goes on to locate &lt;em&gt;jugaad&lt;/em&gt; in a changing global economic and ecological model. Her argument largely describes a ‘new global context’ for &lt;em&gt;innovation&lt;/em&gt;, features of which appear to be somewhat similar to those identified as creating the need for ‘reverse innovation.’ In brief, ‘reverse innovation’ refers to a changing global situation where the market condition in the ‘global south’ — characterised by three key differences: lesser income levels, lack of existing infrastructures, and greater environmental concerns — becomes increasingly representative of the world market condition. The ‘reverse’ part in ‘reverse innovation’ does indicate a similar colonial/orientalist prejudice regarding the geography of human &lt;em&gt;innovations&lt;/em&gt;. Then again the term ‘reverse innovation’ sits within a very limited context of management strategies of European multinational firms, and refers only to a change in the location of its &lt;em&gt;innovation&lt;/em&gt; practices and R&amp;amp;D labs, and not so much about everyday &lt;em&gt;innovations&lt;/em&gt; taking place across the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;../img/jugaad-dilbert.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;code&#34; title=&#34;Dilbert by Scott Adams, Sunday Strip, 13 February 2011.&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&#34;dilbert-by-scott-adams-sunday-strip-13-february-2011-dilbert-by-scott-adams-sunday-strip-13-february-2011:6e36930df60a683ee728bc7e1f91008e&#34;&gt;Dilbert by Scott Adams, Sunday Strip, &lt;a href=&#34;Dilbert by Scott Adams, Sunday Strip, 13 February 2011&#34;&gt;13 February 2011&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Reverse Innovation’ demands a significantly different product development and marketing response from global (European and European-market-oriented) firms. They must embrace the conditions in the ‘global south,’ develop and market products for them, and revise and re-position those same products for the ‘developed world’ markets— thus reversing the flow of product &lt;em&gt;innovation&lt;/em&gt;. Now, what does &lt;em&gt;jugaad&lt;/em&gt; add to this story by focusing on material scarcity and ecological un-sustainability as dominant market conditions across the world? Whereas ‘reverse innovation’ suggests a concrete global business strategy reconfiguration (including for those ‘developing world’ firms that cater to the global consumers), &lt;em&gt;jugaad&lt;/em&gt; tends to highlight low cost product innovations in the ‘informal’ economies of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The special idea of &lt;em&gt;jugaad&lt;/em&gt; (for Adelheid Fischer and in majority literature, including the ‘&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pbs.org/wnet/need-to-know/culture/jugaad-urbanism-the-mother-of-invention/9414/&#34;&gt;Jugaad Urbanism&lt;/a&gt;’ exhibition) seems to come from the recycling/modified-usage cultures of materially poor societies, and it becomes rather vague when the same word is used to mark &lt;em&gt;innovations&lt;/em&gt; in the ‘formal’ economy — such as low-cost cars and multi-functional housing models. What seems more scandalous is that often such &lt;em&gt;jugaad&lt;/em&gt; examples are premised on the exploitation of human labour (such as the minimally paid workers of the famous Dabbawallahs of Mumbai), or of natural resources (such as the celebrated Tata Nano, with its own and allied factories coming up on highly subsidized plots of land). Let’s ask a counter-question here: why is it necessary to bring in &lt;em&gt;jugaad&lt;/em&gt; to focus on material scarcity and ecological un-sustainability? Are they not already well-represented by the omnipresent economic crises and the green agenda? Or, is &lt;em&gt;jugaad&lt;/em&gt; being reduced to a design/behavioural response to a general condition of scarcity and ecological crisis so that some other implication of this global practice is silenced? Is there anything truly disruptive in the idea of &lt;em&gt;jugaad&lt;/em&gt;, or is it just a happy process of dignity under poverty through grassroots ingenuity?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me offer a different and provocative way of looking at &lt;em&gt;jugaad&lt;/em&gt;. It is neither a strategy of informal product economies, nor does it emanate from the ‘worldview of the poor.’ It is not an artifact of an older community-based sustainable product culture, which is under threat from globalised commodity cultures. It is a form of imagining and engaging with formal systems — of design, of governance, of urban planning and so on. &lt;em&gt;Jugaad&lt;/em&gt; refers to a culture of understanding and taking part in formal systems, which are unfamiliar but excessively real, and have deep everyday consequences. The first moment of &lt;em&gt;jugaad&lt;/em&gt; lies in being face-to-face with an unknown or exclusive system — be it the modern electricity distribution system or a new car engine. The practitioner of &lt;em&gt;jugaad&lt;/em&gt;, or the &lt;em&gt;jugadoo&lt;/em&gt;, then addresses this unknown/exclusive but in-your-face system by innovating and often subverting the formal logic of that system — for example, by illegally ‘hooking’ from the official electricity lines, or by repairing the car engine using unorthodox/recycled/self-made parts. This is the second moment of &lt;em&gt;jugaad&lt;/em&gt;. Now there are two qualities of these two moments: (1) these moments are social experiences and not something undertaken individually, and (2) these moments involve simultaneous participation into and subversion of the formal system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;../img/jugaad-not-stumped-but-bricked.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;code&#34; title=&#34;Not stumped but bricked.&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&#34;source-times-of-india:6e36930df60a683ee728bc7e1f91008e&#34;&gt;Source: Times of India.&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first moment of &lt;em&gt;jugaad&lt;/em&gt;, as identified above, is a collective systemic experience of a formal logic that one is not familiar with, or one is excluded from (materially and cognitively). The second moment, or the activities of the jugadoo, is read and appreciated in the context of such a collective experience. Further, the second moment involves a paradoxical attempt to belong to a formal system by bending its rules. Jugaad then is perhaps disruptive but strictly not revolutionary. And that often is the story of Non-European modernities in a nutshell. ‘Jugaad formalism,’ to borrow the term from David Stairs, refers to the resultant system of formal logics and practices that lives in a hybrid existence with elements and practices that undermine and sustain them simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me add an important note here. In an oblique way, I have come to agree with the identification of ‘everything-and-nothing’ as &lt;em&gt;jugaad&lt;/em&gt;. There happens to be a disturbing similarity between how a local entrepreneur builds the ‘jugaad buggy’ to belong to the exclusive automobile culture by subverting its logic, and how the big car companies facing unfamiliar politically-mediated land markets undertake secret deals with the government to open subsidized factories, which simultaneously enjoy official recognition and undermine the democratic space. Hence, and crucially so, &lt;em&gt;jugaad&lt;/em&gt; does not have anything to do with the ‘worldview of the poor’. It is practiced by the poor and the rich alike, resulting in widely different ethical and material consequences. The celebration of &lt;em&gt;jugaad&lt;/em&gt; as creative or subversive is particularly problematic because of its will-to-silence when it comes to these various facets of practices of &lt;em&gt;jugaad&lt;/em&gt; by different socio-economic classes. Conversely, criticisms of &lt;em&gt;jugaad&lt;/em&gt;, for it being closely associated with cultures of corruption on one hand and with incompetent design on the other, tend to highlight the fact that it reinforces the existing systems and hierarchies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jugaad&lt;/em&gt; is a deeply troubling feature of everyday life in India in particular and across the world in general. It challenges the purity of formal/formalist systems. Further, it challenges the illusion that impurity will lead to failure of formal/formalist systems. It foregrounds the pathetic sustained everyday lives of simulated impure forms — from war-exporting democracies to revanchist cities to translucent green plastic lotas. As &lt;a href=&#34;http://design-altruism-project.org/2012/05/08/jugaad-formalism/#comment-105197&#34;&gt;Arvind Lodaya suggests&lt;/a&gt;, all these artifacts of formal glory — democracy, city, and lota — are under great stress from the clashes of product and production cultures. The popular embracing of the &lt;em&gt;jugaad&lt;/em&gt; strategy is based upon the mistaken belief that these artifacts, and others, can be sustained by a continuous subversion that keeps them ecologically and economically viable. And that is the deeper reason for this recent global fascination with &lt;em&gt;jugaad&lt;/em&gt;. It vindicates the humanitarian design agenda — it repeats and reinforces the global story that if the non-designer/non-&lt;em&gt;innovator&lt;/em&gt; third world slum-dwellers can do it, the designers/&lt;em&gt;innovators&lt;/em&gt; can do it even better!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To offer yet another provocation, it is hardly challenging to imagine why this idea of &lt;em&gt;jugaad&lt;/em&gt; is exciting for a global designer community interested in ‘intervening’ in the everyday problems of unfamiliar societies in unknown parts of the world. Members of such global designer communities, for obvious reasons, may identify directly with the character of the &lt;em&gt;jugadoo&lt;/em&gt;, facing alien situations and providing &lt;em&gt;innovative&lt;/em&gt; pro-establishment solutions. Hence it is important that in this global story, the &lt;em&gt;jugadoo&lt;/em&gt; is described as somebody who is happy to be part of a global product and production culture. It conveniently suppresses the possibility that the ‘scarcity’ against which the &lt;em&gt;jugadoo&lt;/em&gt; is fighting, is also produced by that same global culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tragedy is not simply that the innovations of the ‘Non-European/99%/global south’ are categorised under terms that carry a sense of being ‘lesser/backward/temporary,’ but that their innovations are categorised as a lesser/backward/temporary form of &lt;em&gt;innovation&lt;/em&gt;, where the latter is necessarily and immediately a part of global product and production cultures. It is not enough to ask whether Non-Europeans can innovate and expose the biases of global stories of &lt;em&gt;jugaad&lt;/em&gt;. One must also ask, &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; Non-Europeans innovate? Or for that matter, &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; Europeans innovate?&lt;/p&gt;
