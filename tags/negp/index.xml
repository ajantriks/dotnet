&lt;p&gt;I presented this paper at &lt;a href=&#34;http://sarai.net/social-and-cultural-life-of-information/&#34;&gt;The Social and Cultural Life of Information workshop&lt;/a&gt; organised by the Sarai Programme, CSDS, on November 14-16, 2013. “It brought together a select group of media scholars, historians, anthropologists and geographers for an intensive two day workshop, and aimed at bringing together research on colonial and postcolonial information infrastructures, with a strong South Asian component.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;excerpt:4b3345dd999e8171226a4ff304e711cf&#34;&gt;Excerpt&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper is about a &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; technology of addressing the population, the Aadhaar project, that is under construction in India. Like all (self-declared) &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; technologies, it involves a continued engagement and negotiations with of older technological infrastructures and practices. In this paper, I critically examine the claim of newness by the Aadhaar project, and argue that this newness is to be found in the information infrastructure of governance that the Aadhaar project envisions and promotes, as opposed to the demographic and biometric data it gathers. Brian Larkin brings forward another crucial aspect of the techniques and technologies of addressing. He reminds us that addressing may not necessarily involve a pre-existing object, or an object existing independent of the act of addressing at all. Addressing can be employed to create a semblance of systemic integrity, by referring &amp;ldquo;to the material qualities of the signifier itself rather than to its referential meaning&amp;rdquo; &lt;code&gt;(Larkin 2013: 334)&lt;/code&gt;. It is the army of ghost beneficiaries of welfare-services populating the existing databases of ‘target populations&amp;rsquo; across government departments that the Aadhaar project aims to exorcise in its attempt to re-address the nation, by making them addressable through unique identification numbers with verifiable authenticity (one-to-one correspondence between a number and the resident it refers to)&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Explaining the narrower idea of &amp;ldquo;information infrastructure,&amp;rdquo; Geoffrey Bowker et al employ a stricter concept of ‘infrastructure&amp;rsquo; – defined as &amp;ldquo;pervasive enabling resources in network form&amp;rdquo; &lt;code&gt;(Bowker et al 2010: 98)&lt;/code&gt;. The twin emphasis on the network form and its pervasiveness foreground the question of scale threshold of infrastructure. In a crucial intervention, Bowker et al argue for moving the understanding of infrastructure away from something that is in the background, transparent, already-existing and hence can only be studied by its inversion, or in the moment of its breakdown. They approach infrastructure as &amp;ldquo;a fundamentally relational concept,&amp;rdquo; that is in terms of its relationships with other artifacts and processes, specific substantial qualities and spatio-temporal structures of such relationships, relative visibilities of the infrastructure vis-a-vis the other artifacts, and especially the scale and depth of socio-political and organisational interaction, resistance, debate and reconfiguration it generates &lt;code&gt;(Ibid. 99)&lt;/code&gt;. Further, Bowker et al re-introduce the term ‘infrastructural inversion&amp;rsquo; and define it as &amp;ldquo;shifting the emphasis from changes in infrastructural components to changes in infrastructural relations.&amp;rdquo; In his earlier work, Bowker describes the idea of &amp;ldquo;infrastructural inversion&amp;rdquo; as a strategy for foregrounding how technological intervention is not merely about application of scientific or technological reason but substantially involves a strategy of organisation, of assemblage, that is &amp;ldquo;applied simultaneously to the social and natural worlds so as to make them converge&amp;rdquo; &lt;code&gt;(Bowker 1994: 104)&lt;/code&gt;. In this paper, I find his later formulation of the concept through ‘infrastructural components&amp;rsquo; and ‘infrastructural relations&amp;rsquo; – almost as an analogy to the ‘means of production&amp;rsquo; and ‘relations of production&amp;rsquo; – most useful. In this paper I employ the same strategy to read the infrastructural propositions of the Aadhaar project,  and to focus not on the content of the generated unique identity number or the biopolitical economy of their production, but on the relational implications of the project for the national information infrastructure of electronic governance&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taha Mehmood begins an extensive survey of the ‘contested history of National Identity Card in India&amp;rsquo; with the Kargil War of 1999 and the subsequent report of the Kargil Review Committee &lt;code&gt;(Mehmood 2008)&lt;/code&gt;. The executive summary of the report was presented to the members of the Upper House of Parliament on February 25, 2000, and was published later after selective deletion of information (in the interest of national security). Among other recommendations about military, intelligence and general administration in border areas, the report suggested that &amp;ldquo;steps should be taken to issue ID Cards to border villagers in certain vulnerable areas on a priority basis,  pending its extension to other or all parts of the State [of Jammu and Kashmir]&amp;rdquo; &lt;code&gt;(National Security Council Secretariat 1999: 263)&lt;/code&gt;. While, committees and reports that immediately followed this report did not highlight the need for a National Identity Card, the same demand came back in the aftermath of the attack on the Indian Parliament on December 13, 2001. The spatial short circuiting caused by the site of ‘intrusion&amp;rsquo; shifting rapidly from the frontier territory of mountain peaks of Kashmir to the symbolic heart of the nation in New Delhi, perhaps shaped the public acceptance of border securitisation technologies, like unique identity cards embedded with biometric details, as applicable to the entire span of the country. The demand for such a card was eventually shaped into a national project titled Multi-Purpose National Identity Card (MNIC), later categorised as one of the Central Mission Mode Projects of the National E-Governance Plan &lt;code&gt;(Mehmood 2008, DeitY 2011)&lt;/code&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The phrase &amp;ldquo;unique identification,&amp;rdquo; however, did not originate with the post-Kargil war security analysis and recommendations. It possibly first appeared in the Long Term National IT Policy report of the National Task Force on Information Technology and Software Development &lt;code&gt;(NTFoITaSD 1999)&lt;/code&gt;, published in April 1999, barely a few months before the war. The report recommended that &amp;ldquo;[i]n the long run citizens must have unique identification Cards – the Citizen ID&amp;hellip; A smart card citizen ID with multi-functions [should] also be launched. The private sector will be actively associated by ensuring a business angle in the project* &lt;code&gt;(Ibid. #70)&lt;/code&gt;. Both these terms &amp;ldquo;unique identification&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;citizen ID&amp;rdquo; are also used by Nandan Nilekani when within a month of the declaration by the Empowered Group of Ministers regarding the making of the UIDAI, he wrote on how a &amp;ldquo;single citizen ID&amp;rdquo; can get rid of the phantoms that haunt the welfare delivery systems in India &lt;code&gt;(Nilekani 2008)&lt;/code&gt;. In the same article, Nilekani provided an early road map of the approach of the Aadhaar project. He referred to Arvind Virmani&amp;rsquo;s efforts to initiate implementation of MASCs and critiqued the (then) ongoing folly of identifying the &amp;ldquo;issuing [of] smart cards as the main challenge of implementing such a system,&amp;rdquo; whereas &amp;ldquo;[i]t is in making the back-end infrastructure secure and scalable, providing a single record keeper for the whole country and integrating the agents who issue these numbers that it gets tough&amp;rdquo; (Ibid.). This position of Nilekani has defined the problem statement of the Aadhaar project since. The philosophical and practical problem that the Aadhaar project tries to solve is that of representing a person using a number, where the one-to-one correspondence between the person and the number can be repeatedly verified. Unlike the problem statement, the solution, however, is not inspiring. While the Aadhaar number itself is an arbitrarily assigned or random number, that is it does not have any causal relation to the information shared by the person (or the Aadhaar number holder) during the act of enrollment, once mapped to a person or to the set of (demographic and bodily/biometric) information shared by the person, the relationship between this otherwise-arbitrary number and the person it signifies (in the Aadhaar database) can only be ‘authenticated&amp;rsquo; if the person is able to produce the same piece (or combination of pieces) of bodily/biometric information provided at the beginning. This creates a bizarre burden upon the person concerned to maintain a certain (selective) bodily integrity, to sustain the authenticity of the relationship with an arbitrary number&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CIDR rests at the centre of the information infrastructure imagined and under deployment by the Aadhaar project &lt;code&gt;(UIDAI 2010a: 10-13)&lt;/code&gt;. On one hand, it is the centralised (not in a physical sense but in an architectural sense) repository of all the assigned Aadhaar numbers along with the corresponding demographic (name, date of birth, sex, family details, and residential address), biometric (photograph of face, and scans of both iris and all fingers), and additional information (e-mail address, mobile number, bank account number to be linked with the Aadhaar number, etc.) collected during the &amp;ldquo;enrollment&amp;rdquo; process; and against which database the de-duplication exercise takes place when a new bundle of demographic and biographic data enter the Aadhaar system for assignment of an Aadhaar number. On the other, it receives the electronically shared information by the Aadhaar number holder for ‘authentication&amp;rsquo; of the one-to-one correspondence between the number and its holder, and sends the verification result as a Yes/No message &lt;code&gt;(Ibid., UIDAI 2010b)&lt;/code&gt;. Now this is all that the Aadhaar project, in its maturity, is expected to perform – authentication of the relationship between a random number pre-assigned to a person and a person who claims that a particular number has been assigned to him/her. While, the description may seem anti-climactic, it performs a fundamental and critical infrastructural operation for linking the distributed agency-specific databases operated by government bodies of all scale and size, inherited from the past decades of information systems for electronic governance. CIDR, hence, is not simply a database of identities, it is a database of identifiers. Its logic of operation draws more from a technological culture of database management, as evident from its embracing of technical terms such as &amp;ldquo;unique identification number&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;de-duplication&amp;rdquo; for abstract conceptualisation of intimately political processes of formation of social identities and collectivities, than from the logic of a governmental panopticon or a totalising information repository, as evident from its attempts to minimise the personal information collected during the &amp;ldquo;enrollment&amp;rdquo; process and to  avoid political messiness by specifically not collecting information regarding &amp;ldquo;race, religion, caste, tribe, ethnicity, language, income or health&amp;rdquo; &lt;code&gt;(Ibid.)&lt;/code&gt;. It is not aimed at undertaking financial surveillance across all public and private transactions taking place in the county, but at enabling the same&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The actual realisation of the Aadhaar project as a ‘platform&amp;rsquo; to be leveraged by all the government agencies remains open to chances, to be determined by political negotiations, civil society activisms, intra-governmental administrative reforms politics and so on. This paper, however, is not about the chances of the Aadhaar project being implemented, the eventual forms of its implementation, and political economic struggles created in its wake. It is about tracing and locating its vision of rethinking information infrastructure of governance in India. Hence, in this paper, I mark a historic period in the transformations of the information infrastructure of governance in India, where there is great resistance and confusion regarding the very act and the multi-dimensional implications, especially for the national administrative structure, of the specter of a &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; national information infrastructure of governance. The key, as I argue in this paper, for confronting the changes in the national information architecture, including its possibilities of breakdown, spillage, splintering, and totalising biopolitical gaze, that this spectral Aadhaar project proposes and deploys, is not to be found in the infrastructural components that it mobilises (e.g., biometric scanners, the Aadhaar number, CIDR) but in the infrastructural relations that it necessitates (e.g., incorporation of the Aadhaar number-based authentication process into welfare delivery activities of various government agencies, and the technical requirements for their internal information architecture reform)&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
