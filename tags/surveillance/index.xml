&lt;h4 id=&#34;published-by-the-wire-http-thewire-in-2016-04-19-the-last-chance-for-a-welfare-state-doesnt-rest-in-the-aadhaar-system-30256:fdeadc845334f57050ce5e7050d1e1c7&#34;&gt;Published by &lt;a href=&#34;http://thewire.in/2016/04/19/the-last-chance-for-a-welfare-state-doesnt-rest-in-the-aadhaar-system-30256/&#34;&gt;The Wire&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once upon a time, a king desired that his parrot should be taught all the ancient knowledge of the kingdom. The priests started feeding the pages of the great books to the parrot with much enthusiasm. One day, the king asked the priests if the parrot’s education has completed. The priests poked the belly of the parrot but it made no sound. Only the rustle of undigested pages inside the belly could be heard. The priests declared that the parrot is indeed a learned one now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fate of the welfare system in our country is quite similar to this parrot from Tagore’s parable. It has been forcefully fed identification cards and other official documents (often four copies of the same) for years, and always with the same justification of making it more effective and fixing the leaks. These identification regimes are in effect killing off the welfare system. And some may say that that has been the actual plan in any case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Aadhaar number has been recently offered as &lt;a href=&#34;http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/aadhaar-project-uidai-last-chance-for-a-welfare-state/&#34;&gt;the ‘last chance’ for the ailing welfare system&lt;/a&gt; – a last identification regime that it needs to gulp down to survive. This argument wilfully overlooks the acute problems with the Aadhaar project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, the ‘last chance’ for a welfare state in India is not provided by implementing a new and improved identification regime (Aadhaar numbers or otherwise), but by enabling citizens to effectively track, monitor, and ensure delivery of welfare, services, and benefits. This ‘opening up’ of the welfare bureaucracy has been most effectively initiated by the Right to Information Act. Instead of a centralised biometrics-linked identity verification platform, which gives the privilege of tracking and monitoring welfare flows only to a few expert groups, an effective welfare state requires the devolution of such privilege and responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We should harness the tracking capabilities of electronic financial systems to disclose how money belonging to the Consolidated Fund of India travel around state agencies and departmental levels. Instead, the Aadhaar system effectively stacks up a range of entry barriers to accessing welfare – from malfunctioning biometric scanners, to connectivity problems, to the burden of keeping one’s fingerprint digitally legible under all labouring and algorithmic circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, authentication of welfare recipients by Aadhaar number neither make the welfare delivery process free of techno-bureaucratic hurdles, nor does it exorcise away corruption. Anumeha Yadav has recently documented the emerging &lt;a href=&#34;http://scroll.in/article/805909/in-rajasthan-there-is-unrest-at-the-ration-shop-because-of-error-ridden-aadhaar&#34;&gt;‘unrest at the ration shop’ across Rajasthan&lt;/a&gt;, as authentication processes face technical and connectivity delays, people get ‘locked out’ of public services for not having or having Aadhaar number with incorrect demographic details, and no mechanisms exist to provide rapid and definitive recourse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RTI activists at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.snsindia.org/&#34;&gt;Satark Nagrik Sangathan&lt;/a&gt; have highlighted that the Delhi ration shops, using Aadhaar-based authentication, maintain only two columns of data to describe people who have come to the shop – those who received their ration, and those who did not (without any indication of the reason). This leads to erasure-by-design of evidence of the number of welfare-seekers who are excluded from welfare services when the Aadhaar-based authentication process fails (for valid reasons, or otherwise).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reetika Khera has made it very clear that using Aadhaar Payments Bridge to directly transfer cash to a beneficiary’s account, in the best case scenario, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.epw.in/journal/2013/05/commentary/cost-benefit-analysis-uid.html&#34;&gt;may only take care of one form of corruption&lt;/a&gt;: deception (a different person claiming to be the beneficiary). But it does not address the other two common forms of public corruption: collusion (government officials approving undue benefits and creating false beneficiaries) and extortion (forceful rent seeking after the cash has been transferred to the beneficiary’s account). Evidently, going after only deception does not make much sense in an environment where collusion and extortion are commonplace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, the ‘relevant privacy question’ for Aadhaar is not limited to how UIDAI protects the data collected by it, but expands to usage of Aadhaar numbers across the public and private sectors. The privacy problem created by the Aadhaar numbers does &lt;em&gt;begin&lt;/em&gt; but surely not &lt;em&gt;end&lt;/em&gt; with internal data management procedures and responsibilities of the UIDAI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On one hand, the Aadhaar Bill 2016 has reduced the personal data sharing restrictions of the NIAI Bill 2010, and has &lt;a href=&#34;http://scroll.in/article/806297/no-longer-a-black-box-why-does-the-revised-aadhar-bill-allow-sharing-of-identity-information&#34;&gt;allowed for sharing of all data except core biometrics (fingerprints and iris scan)&lt;/a&gt; with all agencies involved in authentication of a person through her/his Aadhaar number. These agencies have been asked to seek consent from the person who is being authenticated, and to inform her/him of the ways in which the provided data (by the person, and by UIDAI) will be used by the agency. In careful wording, the Bill only asks the agencies to &lt;em&gt;inform&lt;/em&gt; the person about “alternatives to submission of identity information to the requesting entity” (Section 8.3) but not to &lt;em&gt;provide&lt;/em&gt; any such alternatives. This facilitates and legalises a much wider collection of personal demographic data for offering of services by public agencies “or any body corporate or person” (Section 57), which is way beyond the scope of data management practices of UIDAI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the Aadhaar number is being &lt;em&gt;seeded&lt;/em&gt; to all government databases – from lists of HIV patients, of rural citizens being offered 100 days of work, of students getting scholarships meant for specific social groups, of people with a bank account. Now in some sectors, such as banking, inter-agency sharing of data about clients is strictly regulated. But we increasingly have non-financial agencies playing crucial roles in the financial sector – from mobile wallets to peer-to-peer transaction to innovative credit ratings. Seeding of Aadhaar into all government and private databases would allow for easy and direct joining up of these databases by anyone who has access to them, and not at all by security agencies only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it becomes publicly acceptable that &lt;a href=&#34;http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/aadhaar-project-uidai-last-chance-for-a-welfare-state/&#34;&gt;the &lt;em&gt;money bill route&lt;/em&gt; was a ‘remedial’ instrument&lt;/a&gt; to put the Rajya Sabha ‘back on track’, one cannot not wonder about what was being remedied by avoiding a public debate about the draft bill before it was presented in Lok Sabha. The answer is simple: &lt;em&gt;welfare is the message, surveillance is the medium&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Acceptance and adoption of all medium requires a message, a content. The users are interested in the message. The message, however, is not the business. Think of Free Basics. Facebook wants people with none or limited access to internet to enjoy parts of the internet at zero data cost. Facebook does not provide the content that the users consume on such internet. The content is created by the users themselves, and also provided by other companies. Facebook own and control the medium, and makes money out of all content, including interactions, passing through it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UIDAI has set up a biometric data bank and related infrastructure to offer authentication-as-a-service. As the Bill clarifies, almost all agencies (public or private, national or global) can use this service to verify the identity of Indian residents. Unlike Facebook, the content of these services do not flow through the Aadhaar system. Nonetheless, Aadhaar keeps track of all ‘authentication records’, that is records of whose identity was authenticated by whom, when, and where. This database is gold (data) mine for security agencies in India, and elsewhere. Further, as more agencies use authentication based on Aadhaar numbers, it becomes easier for them to combine and compare databases with other agencies doing the same, by linking each line of transaction across databases using Aadhaar numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welfare is the message that the Aadhaar system is riding on. The message is only useful for the medium as far as it ensures that the majority of the user population are subscribing to it. Once the users are enrolled, or on-boarded, the medium enables flow of all kinds of messages, and tracking and monetisation (perhaps not so much in the case of UIDAI) of all those flows. It does not matter if the Aadhaar system is being introduced to remedy the broken parliamentary process, or the broken welfare distribution system. What matters is that the UIDAI is establishing the infrastructure for a universal surveillance system in India, and without a formal acknowledgement and legal framework for the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;published-by-the-pop-up-city-http-popupcity-net-these-cities-are-made-for-watchin:c16d05bacacc488815d5e3e5fdb66283&#34;&gt;Published by &lt;a href=&#34;http://popupcity.net/these-cities-are-made-for-watchin/&#34;&gt;The Pop Up City&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;../img/Watch-Dogs.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Codes&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ubisoft.com/de-DE/game/watch-dogs/&#34;&gt;Watch Dogs&lt;/a&gt;, by Ubisoft, has finally come out. In this game, you play an urban hacker in Chicago, who can hack into the operating system of the city and turn the very built environment into a weapon. We have talked about the game &lt;a href=&#34;http://popupcity.net/data-driven-urban-citizenship/&#34;&gt;earlier&lt;/a&gt; in the context of how data-driven urban infrastructures create new possibilities of looking at the city and acting in it — for governments, citizens and hackers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of the advertisement campaign for the game, Devin Graham has directed a short action sequence that brings together parkour running and urban hacking. This amazing clip shows how we inhabit the city both physically and informationally — and can hack it by going beyond the designed circuits of physical movement, and access to information and data-driven control systems. 
&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; padding-top: 30px; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/UIkkiyGKfA0&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;&#34; allowfullscreen frameborder=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such concerns about the collapsing of physical and or informational dimensions of the city is not something that begins with the integration of computers into urban infrastructure. One of the greatest explorations of this topic can be found in Gillo Pontecorvo’s ‘&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Battle_of_Algiers&#34;&gt;The Battle of Algiers&lt;/a&gt;.’ The film narrates the incidents of urban guerilla warfare in Algiers during the Algerian War of 1954-62. Throughout the film, the physicality and the knowledge about the urban spaces of Algiers — divided into the ‘modern’ French town and the ‘native’ city of casbah — is the very object and site of struggle for control of the city. Throughout the film, it is crucial for the French police and military to dominate urban mobility by gaining information about identities, intentions and locations of the Algerians. Converesely, the Algerian guerilla hides their existence not only through physical means (dresses and wells) but also through their knowledge of the alleys of casbah. Interestingly, one of the most iconic sequence of the film is of a boy hijacking a microphone system at a city checkpost and using it to announce pro-Algeria messages. 
&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; padding-top: 30px; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/ToFw7zqJ_sc&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;&#34; allowfullscreen frameborder=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tom Brewster raises the obvious question of whether increasing integration of software and software-controlled hardware into the body of cities is making it more &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/may/21/smart-cities-future-stupid-hack-terrorism-watchdogs&#34;&gt;vulnerable&lt;/a&gt; to cyber-attacks. Last year, Kashmir Hill, senior online editor at Forbes, demonstrated how common security-lapses can allow strangers to gain &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2013/07/26/smart-homes-hack/#6013508f46a5&#34;&gt;control over ‘smart home’ devices&lt;/a&gt; via internet. Brewster further shows how these vulenerabilities of smart systems may not only come from mistakes while deploying or configuring them, but can simply be caused by &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/message/everything-is-broken-81e5f33a24e1#.ixgu30qhv&#34;&gt;sloppy code&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To prove the point, a researcher from security consultancy IOActive recently showed that vulnerabilities in road sensors relaying information to traffic lights could be exploited to turn them from red to green, or keep them on a certain colour. The potential impact is all too obvious: traffic carnage and deadly accidents… Many of the weaknesses are basic, [Cesar Cerrudo] says: devices often don’t do adequate validation of the data being sent to them, failing to check whether malicious streams of information are being sent rather than legitimate bits and bytes determining their functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a pattern here: Watch Dogs imagines a smart city that is under control of ‘corrupt officials’ and ‘elite hackers;’ Hill talks about errors commited by uses that expose smart devices; and Brewster reveals how internal shortcomings of smart systems may lead to real-world disasters. In all these narratives, something needs to go wrong — either the people running the smart city, the people deploying the smart systems, or the software running the smart systems — for the smart city to hit a 404 page (or worse). 
&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; padding-top: 30px; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/1hpU_Neg1KA&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;&#34; allowfullscreen frameborder=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such an imagination of the ‘threat’ of smart cities completely ignores the physical and informational surveillance that will be undertaken as &lt;em&gt;normal&lt;/em&gt; everyday life in a smart city. Data coming out of such surveillance devices will of course be consumed and acted upon by machines and humans alike — as Edward Snowden’s revealations have shown. Further, this entire surveillance will often take place without the residents noticing or giving attention to. Neither the governments nor the corporates, the key controllers of such smart city utilities, have much reputation when it comes to respecting electronic privacy of people, or sensitising the users to seriously consider terms of data usage before using a product/service. The big threat of smart cities does not come from malfunctioning or abuse of those systems, but from their normal usages. These are cities made for watching, and they don’t necessarily come with in-built mechanisms for citizens to watch the watchers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;published-by-the-pop-up-city-http-popupcity-net-data-driven-urban-citizenship:2f52587dce86bf93b3695e81c3323592&#34;&gt;Published by &lt;a href=&#34;http://popupcity.net/data-driven-urban-citizenship/&#34;&gt;The Pop Up City&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With networked infrastructures mixing with physical fabric of the cities (check out &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ipavement.com/en/&#34;&gt;iPavement&lt;/a&gt;, paving tiles with embedded microcomputer), there is a gradually growing body of urban data. Often this data is not collected or not stored. Often it is stored without being shared. A steady trickling out of this urban data, however, is taking place through open data platforms and various public-private data partnerships. While there emerges a political demand for rights regarding networked objects (see &lt;a href=&#34;http://videos.liftconference.com/video/2902438/adam-greenfield-on-public&#34;&gt;Adam Greenfield&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bruno-latour.fr/sites/default/files/96-DINGPOLITIK-GB.pdf&#34;&gt;Bruno Latour&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.nearfuturelaboratory.com/2006/02/26/a-manifesto-for-networked-objects/&#34;&gt;Near Future Laboratory&lt;/a&gt;), a range of products, services and platforms are coming up that offer to enrich citizenship with accessible and visualised data. 
&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; padding-top: 30px; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;//player.vimeo.com/video/21351764&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;&#34; webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The everyday citizenship in urban areas is increasingly augmented by all kinds of incoming data visuals — &lt;a href=&#34;http://mappinglondon.co.uk/2012/mapped-every-bus-trip-in-london/&#34;&gt;map of ‘every bus trip’&lt;/a&gt; in the city, possibilities of using the same data to pre-empt congestion and resolving them by diversifying traffic, &lt;a href=&#34;http://spatialanalysis.co.uk/2012/04/twitter-languages-london/&#34;&gt;geographic spread of different languages&lt;/a&gt; used to tweet across the city, crime landscape of the cities (and of course you remember &lt;a href=&#34;http://stamen.com/work/crimespotting/&#34;&gt;Crimespotting by Stamen&lt;/a&gt;), catching criminals by real-time data mining, &lt;a href=&#34;http://urbmet.org/&#34;&gt;visualisation of energy and resource intensities&lt;/a&gt; of your city, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.hypercities.com/&#34;&gt;exploratory platform&lt;/a&gt; for historical visuals and documents embedded on the city map. 
&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; padding-top: 30px; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/pPjKQfGeJv4&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;&#34; allowfullscreen frameborder=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At a much more extensive scale, the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bartlett.ucl.ac.uk/casa&#34;&gt;Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis, UCL&lt;/a&gt; has developed a &lt;a href=&#34;http://citydashboard.org/london/&#34;&gt;city-wide dashboard&lt;/a&gt; for London that pulls in various environmental, transportation, social and other variables and information. The &lt;a href=&#34;http://livehoods.org/&#34;&gt;Livehoods&lt;/a&gt; portal takes a more social-media intensive approach to create similar city-scale visualisation of human interactions. It employs machine-learning algorithms to &lt;a href=&#34;http://livehoods.org/research&#34;&gt;mine urban conversations&lt;/a&gt; taking place in social networks and create insights about urban living patterns. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.urbanmobs.fr/en/&#34;&gt;Urban Mobs&lt;/a&gt; takes a similar approach to analyse and visualise ‘crowd communication activities’ using mobile usage data (from Orange). A common problem for such data exploration interfaces is the thickness of information layers — various kinds data about each location makes it difficult to read. &lt;a href=&#34;http://senseable.mit.edu/&#34;&gt;MIT SENSEable City Lab&lt;/a&gt; has developed a visualisation interface called &lt;a href=&#34;http://senseable.mit.edu/visual-explorations-urban-mobility/data-lenses.html&#34;&gt;Data Lenses&lt;/a&gt;. It allows one to separately track variables, to switch between variables to understand patterns, to change zoom levels for various scalar comparison — so as to ease the urban ‘information overload’. 
&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; padding-top: 30px; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/P_XBL5hYiqQ&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;&#34; allowfullscreen frameborder=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In April, the Open-Data Cities Conference was organised in Brighton, UK, which argued that — “The more data that is released – without strings attached, in machine-readable and non-proprietary &amp;lsquo;open&amp;rsquo; formats – the more likely it is that businesses and developers will use it to build the applications and services that world-class cities need.” The qualities of the ‘world-class cities’ were not clear to begin with and now with informatics thrown in it accumulated further complexity and confusion. Here the idea of ‘open urban data’ is almost like a subsidy — if the government provides no-strings attached data subsidy, then private agencies can use it to produce and address infrastructural needs of digital cities. It remains unanswered how the citizens who have contributed to creation of that data will benefit as governments open up data for commercial use by private agencies (here is a strange case of &lt;a href=&#34;sfappeal.com/news/2009/06/who-owns-sfmta-arrival-data.php&#34;&gt;citizens asked to buy back urban data&lt;/a&gt; created by them). 
&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; padding-top: 30px; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;//player.vimeo.com/video/42553502&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;&#34; webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a recent series of articles, Urban Times and Design Mind have been exploring this data-driven &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theurbn.com/category/feature/future-of-the-city&#34;&gt;future of cities in the digital age&lt;/a&gt;. The insightful discussion explores the many challenges being faced by engineers, coders, designers, politicians, citizens etc as the ‘smart city’ model of infrastructure provision and management becomes commonplace. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theurbn.com/2012/05/the-future-of-the-city-2-the-networked-urban-environment/&#34;&gt;It notes&lt;/a&gt; that much of the controversy regarding this data-driven approach is entangled with questions of “public and private ownership of space, both in the cloud and on the ground.” 
&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; padding-top: 30px; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/Qs4OcQNOM34&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;&#34; allowfullscreen frameborder=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And computer games continue to be right at the cutting edge of spatial speculations. A new game by Ubisoft named ‘&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ubisoft.com/de-DE/game/watch-dogs/&#34;&gt;Watch Dogs&lt;/a&gt;‘ is built around a ‘smart city’ operator gone rogue. The centralised urban informatics system is under siege and turned into the weapon against the urban itself. As &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.citylab.com/tech/2012/06/dark-side-smart-city-video-game/2184/&#34;&gt;Nate Berg notes&lt;/a&gt;, the emerging control of spatial systems and built forms by data-driven infrastructure create new possibilities of controlling cities and inflicting networked terror. Of course such systems also create possibilities of counter-vigilance by data-driven citizens. However, data rights of such citizens and data responsibilities of the governments need to be developed and implemented.&lt;/p&gt;
